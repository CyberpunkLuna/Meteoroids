This is blatant clone of asteroids!
Starting out as a boot.dev project I have and will be extending this out till I feel satisfied with the end product.

Possible improvements:

    Implement multiple lives and respawning
    Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
    Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
    Add a background image / generate new starry scenes from multiple sprites
    Create different weapon types
    Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
    Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
    Add a shield power-up
    Add a speed/manuverability power-up
    Add bombs that can be dropped

Extended feature already added:

    Scoring system
    Player velocity
