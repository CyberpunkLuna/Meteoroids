This is blatant clone of asteroids!
Starting out as a boot.dev project I have and will be extending this out till I feel satisfied with the end product.

Possible improvements:

    Bootdev suggested improvements:
        
        Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
        Add a background image / generate new starry scenes from multiple sprites
        Create different weapon types
        Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
        Add a shield power-up
        Add a speed/manuverability power-up
        Add bombs that can be dropped
        
    Self-directed improvements:
        Different types of asteroids
            each type has a special ability or difficulty
            asteroids drop resources/powerups
        Coloured "engine" sprite for player when player goes forwards
        different "levels" each with different difficulties
        a main menu
        a death screen in-between respawns

Extended feature already added:

    Scoring system
    Player velocity
    Make the player wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
    Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
    Implement multiple lives and respawning
